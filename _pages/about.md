Hi! I'm Wayles, 2nd year Ph.D Student in Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University working with [Professor Taekyoung "Ted" Kwon](https://mmlab.snu.ac.kr/).

My general research interests are in Network Security and Privacy. Currently, I am working on Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI) using blockchain techonlogy.I'm also interested in Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) such as Multi-party Computation (MPC), Differential Privacy (DP), and Functional Encryption (FE). I am also conducting a project on utilizing FE on Real Time Bidding/Online Behavioral Advertisement (OBA).

Before pursuing my doctoral degree, I was a research engineer at [Gridwiz Inc](https://www.gridwiz.com/en/solutions/e-mobility), from 2017 to 2020. I designed and developed communication controllers installed in electric vehicles and charging stations based on de facto standards such as ISO 15118, DIN SPEC 70121, and OCPP. I also participated in numerous interoperability and conformance testing events, as well as standardization activities.

I obtained my MS in Electronic Engieering at Sogang University in 2017, advised by [Professor Ju-Wook Jang](http://monet2.sogang.ac.kr/).
